# WifiPower

The source code (if you can call it that) behind the [www.wifipower.net](https://wifipower.net/) website. 

Website built for fun off of the premise of supplementing POE (power over ethernet) with power over wifi aka. WifiPower.

Utilizes Materialize JS and some other scraped together pieces to build the website template, as well as the HTML5 battery status api to grab your current battery status. Uses the HERE maps api to estimate approximate location.
